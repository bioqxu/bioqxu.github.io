# Research

Our lab investigates the molecular, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying human development and disease by integrating **computational biology, organoid technology, and genome topology studies**. By combining large-scale data integration with mechanistic experimental systems, we aim to uncover fundamental regulatory principles and translate them into therapeutic strategies.

### Integrating Large-Scale Biological Datasets to Decode Cellular States

We specialize in integrating multi-sample and multi-condition datasets to define conserved cellular states and regulatory programs across development and disease.

* **Human Endoderm Organoid Cell Atlas (HEOCA).** We established a single-cell atlas comprising ~1 million cells across diverse endoderm-derived organoid models, including lung, liver, pancreas, intestine, and stomach. HEOCA enables systematic benchmarking of organoid fidelity against primary tissues, reveals ontogenic cell states captured in vitro, and facilitates the identification of disease-associated cellular alterations.
* **Pancreatic Cancer Atlas.** By integrating single-cell transcriptomes from 200 PDAC patient samples, we defined conserved cancer cell and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) states and their signaling interactions. Coupling the atlas with patient-derived tumoroids enabled identification of the CAF-responsive receptor **Syndecan-1 (SDC1)** as a therapeutic vulnerability.

### Engineering Organoid Models to Recapitulate Human Biology

A central focus of our lab is the design and refinement of organoid systems that faithfully model human tissue architecture and function.

* **Adrenal Cortex Organoids.** We developed a stable human fetal adrenal cortex organoid model to study steroidogenesis and zonation, revealing how WNT, BMP/TGFβ, and cAMP signaling coordinate cortical identity and hormone production.
* **Pancreatic Tumoroids.** Our modular patient-derived tumoroids reconstruct tumor–stroma interactions and ductal architecture, providing a platform to study immune evasion and evaluate therapeutic combinations.
* **Epidermal Differentiation Models.** Using iPSCs from EEC syndrome patients carrying *TP63* mutations, we uncovered aberrant mesodermal activation impairing epidermal commitment and demonstrated partial rescue through pathway inhibition.

### From Organoids to Therapeutic Insight

We use organoid systems not only to model biology, but to identify actionable mechanisms.

* Atlas-guided comparisons reveal perturbed cellular states in disease models.
* Tumoroid co-culture systems uncover stromal signals that influence immunotherapy response.
* Adrenal organoids define regulatory circuits controlling steroid production.
* Targeted modulation of lineage-inappropriate gene activation restores defective differentiation programs.

Together, these approaches provide a scalable framework for linking cellular state, regulatory mechanism, and therapeutic opportunity.

### Developing Computational Frameworks for Regulatory Biology

We develop computational tools to decode gene regulation from high-dimensional data.

**ANANSE**, our enhancer-network–based framework, infers gene regulatory networks and identifies key transcription factors driving cell fate transitions. By integrating enhancer activity with transcriptional networks, ANANSE reveals cell type–specific regulators and outperforms promoter-centric approaches. Using this framework, we constructed a cross-tissue atlas of transcription factors across 18 human tissues, advancing our understanding of regulatory control in development and disease.

### Decoding 3D Genome Architecture

We investigate how genome topology shapes gene regulation. Using CRISPR-based editing of chromatin organization, we demonstrated that **CTCF binding site orientation determines chromatin looping specificity**, providing mechanistic support for the loop extrusion model. These findings reveal how three-dimensional genome architecture encodes regulatory programs essential for development and disease.
