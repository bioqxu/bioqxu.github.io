Quan Xu received his B.S. degree in Biotechnology from [Hunan Normal University](https://english.hunnu.edu.cn/) in 2012. He then achieved an M.S. degree in Bioinformatics from [Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine](https://scsb.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2016, where he worked in the lab of [Prof. Dr. Quang Wu](https://scsb.sjtu.edu.cn/Professor/11906.html), focusing on epigenetics and 3D genomic dynamics in gene regulation. Following this, Quan began his Ph.D. at the [Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences](https://www.ru.nl/en/rimls-science), [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/en), the Netherlands, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Gert Jan C. Veenstra](https://veenstralab.nl/), [Prof. Dr. Huiqing Zhou](https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/radboud-institute-for-molecular-life-sciences-fnwi-deel/molecular-developmental-biology/cell-fate-decisions-epithelial-development-disease-group), and [Prof. Dr. Simon J. van Heeringen](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/heeringen-s-van). His research focused on utilizing computational methods to study cell fate determination controlled by transcription factors. He completed his Ph.D. in May 2022. Since January 2021, Quan has been a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of [Prof. Dr. J. Gray Camp](https://institutehumanbiology.com/about-the-ihb/exploratory-research/developmental-systems-and-computational-biology/gray-camp/) at the [Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel](https://iob.ch/), and in the lab of [Prof. Dr. Barbara Treutlein](https://bsse.ethz.ch/qdb) at the [Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering](https://bsse.ethz.ch/), [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Basel, Switzerland. In January 2023, he transitioned to the [Institute of Human Biology (IHB)](https://institutehumanbiology.com/), Basel, Switzerland, continuing his postdoctoral research with Prof. Dr. J. Gray Camp and Prof. Dr. Barbara Treutlein. During his postdoc, he develops and applies computational methods to analyze single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data. His research aims to uncover the fundamental mechanisms involved in the development of the human gastrointestinal tract and the pathogenesis of related diseases, focusing on the characterization of primary tissues and organoids derived from the gastrointestinal tract.
